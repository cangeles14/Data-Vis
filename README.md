# Data Visualization Project @ Ironhack Paris

Fundamentals of Data Visualization. Visualizations help you intuitively understand how the entities in your data compare to each other, how similarly or differently they behave, and where there are values that look extreme or incorrect.

## Purpose

Here I will demonstrate how to use a dataset and utilizing Python, Pandas, Tableau, and MatPlotLib to extract insights on the data. The goal of this project is show how data visualization can enhance your findings from a dataset, allowing your audience to understand and visualize your results.

## Getting Started

Finding database
- [Google Data Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kostyabahshetsyan/video-game-sales-visualization/data)
- [UCI Machine Learning](http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/)

Dataset used here
- [Video Game Sales Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/garfieldliang/video-games-analysis/data)

## First Look & Data Cleaning

Import needed libaries

Take a look at dataset, using pandas and python

Does your data need cleaning?
Are there any null values?
Any errors or missing information preventing you from extracting the data from your dataset?

## Visualization Story/ Outline

By organzing and outlining what you want to focus on, you can narrow in on what data you need.
An outline will provide not only you structure but also structure for your audience.

## Tableau / MatPlotLib

## Conclusions

Data visualization is a strong tool used to effectively show insights, trends, and conclusions on your data set.

## Built With

* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) - The programming language used
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) - library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language
* [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) - Popular Data visualization tool
* [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html) - Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms
