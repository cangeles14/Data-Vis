Fundamentals of Data Visualization. Visualizations help you intuitively understand how the entities in your data compare to each other, how similarly or differently they behave, and where there are values that look extreme or incorrect. Here I will demonstrate how to use my dataset collected with Python, Pandas, Tableau, and MatPlotLib to tell insights on my data.
